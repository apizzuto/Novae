# IceCube Novae Analysis

Novae are transient astrophysical events marked by the rapid brightening of a white dwarf in a binary system. Traditionally, emission was thought to be powered by runaway thermonuclear fusion on the surface of the white dwarf from accretion. However, in 2010, the Fermi-LAT discovered gamma-ray emission from a few Galactic Novae, calling into question the production mechanisms of the detected radiation on/near Earth. 

Here, we investigate the hypothesis that this emission is hadronic, by searching for neutrinos with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.

## Note on Confidentiality

Not all relevant code for the analysis is included in the public repository. Much of the code I used for this analysis is private, and therefore not included here. As a result, running some of these notebooks out of the box will not be successful, as paths point to directories on a private server.
